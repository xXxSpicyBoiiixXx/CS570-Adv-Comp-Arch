TODO: For Proposal it will have a hardware part. Redo proposal. Focus on the hardware component.  

### Question 

- With the introduction of C-AMAT, what is the utilization of a memory system?

### History Review 

- Memory is the performance bound 

- The memory/CPU gap becomes larger and larger 

- Solutions of Memory-Wall 
1) Better memory device/technology (memory wall problem becomes worse) 
2) Memory Hierarchy (Size issue, data movemnet issue) 
3) complictiy (concurrency, utilization issues) 

- C-AMAT is proposed to address the issue of utilzing concurrency under modern memory hierarchy.

### What Missing (practical impact) 

- From multi-core to GPU 
1) GPU is special case of ASIC, other ASIC such as AI?
2) Special hardware considerations? 

- From performance analysis to performance optimization 
1) Scheduling -- Pure miss based, PIM, overlapping, etc. 
2) Increase concurreny -- Prefetching, writeback, etc. 
3) Others -- Research, hardware support for concuurency, a survey, etc. 

The question still reminds, can we apply C-AMAT directly to improve memory system performance. 

There is a textbook formular for a traditional AMAT model in appendix. This is a memory stall time.
