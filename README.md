# Xen Hypervisor 

Follow the guide from: 

https://wiki.xenproject.org/

From here with the Debian distribution up and running, make sure that xen is in the correct path. So run the following. 

export PATH = "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin"

You can also add this to your ~./profile to not have to do this on each reboot.
