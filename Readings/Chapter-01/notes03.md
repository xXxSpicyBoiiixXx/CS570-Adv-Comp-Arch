# Defining Computer Architecutre 

A few decades ago, a comuter architecure referred to only ISA, but now there is a shit ton more stuff that is invovled to the term. 

### Instruction Set Architecture

The term ISA coined in thus text is the programmer visible instruction set. There are several factors that we must consider here. 

1) Class of ISA

* There are two popular versions of ISAs which are register-memory ISA or load-store ISA. All ISAs announced since 1985 are load-store ISAs 

2) Memory addressing: All desktop and server computers basically use byte addressing to access memory operands. 

3) Addressing Modes: ~~ Addressing modes specify the address of a memory object. 

4) Types and Sizes of Operands: This would vary depending on the type of ISA and how many bits they support here and there 

5) Operations: The general categories of operations are data transfer, arithmetic logical, control, and floating point. 

6) Control Flow Instructions: All ISAs include conditional  branches, unconditional jumps, procedure calls, and returns. 

7) Enconding an ISA: There are two things to consider here and that is either fixed length or variable length 

### Designing the Organizationd and Hardware to Meet Goals and Functional Requirements

There are two components: Organziation and hardware 

1) Organization: Computer's  design such as 
* memory system
* memory interconnect
* design of the internal processor or CPU 

It is important to note that instead of organization we can say microarchitecture. 

2) Hardware: detailed logic design, and the packaging technology of the computer. 

So the computer architecture, all three of these aspects of computer design are covered... 
* ISA
* Organization or microarchitecture 
* Hardware 

### Trends in Technology 

So we have to be aware of trends in the today's technology where we have to focus on...

1) Integrated circuit logic technology. 
2) Semiconductor DRAM 
3) Semiconductor Flash
4) Magnetic Disk Technology 
5) Network Technolgoy

### Peroformance Trends: Bandwidth over Latency

Bandwidth or throughput is the total amount of work done in a given time such as MB/s for a disk transfer

Latecny or response time is the time between the start and the completion of an even such as milliseconds for a disk access. 

### Scaling of Transistor Performance and Wires 

-- Feauture size: Minimum size of a transistor or a wire in either x or y dim.
