# Introduction

Microprocessors really did change a lot about the way we think about computers as a whole. This is due to the cost advantages and the growth rate of mass production in microprocessors. 

Also, assembly language programming was basically elimnated due to higher level of abstraction, and standarization of operating systems brought down a lot of overhaul of coming up with new architecures all the time. 

So in terms of instruction level parallism (ILP) and the use of caches, RISC arcitectures were born. The main focus of RISC was these two values which brought tons of attention.

In 2004, we made a switch from uniprocessors to multiprocessors since we couldn't get the current and voltage quite right with just having a uniprocessor. This is known as Dennard Scaling that was dropped and influenced the switch. 

We made the switch from intrsution level parallelism to data-level prallelism and thread-level parallelism. As well as request-level parallelism. 

The main issue is ILP didn't really burden the programmer as much but DLP, TLP, and RLP may burden the programmer a lot to exploit the parallism benefit. 

So what did we learn? Basically below we have that all these factors contributed the improvements of performance to slow down since we went from Moore's Law to basically doubling every 20 years. 

1) Trasistors no longer getting much better because of the slowing of Moore's Law and the end of Dinnard Scaling 
2) The unchanging power budgets for microprocessors
3) The replacement of the single power-hungry processor with several energy efficient proceesors
4) The limits to multiprocessing to achieve Amdahl's Law
