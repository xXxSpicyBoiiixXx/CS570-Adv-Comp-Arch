# Trends in Power and Energy in Integrated Circuits 

Energy is the biggest challenege facing the computer designer for all classes of computers. 

We have to worry about power being brought in and distributed properly and then then removing the heat produced. 

### Power and Energy: A Systems Perspective 

1) What is the max power a processor ever requires? 
2) What is the sustained power consumption? 
3) Consider energy and energy consumption.

To see what processor is more efficient a better comparison is energy consumption (not power) for executing the task.
