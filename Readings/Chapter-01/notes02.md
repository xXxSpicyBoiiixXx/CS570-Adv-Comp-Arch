# Classes of Computers 

Things have changed obviously

### IoT/Embedded Computer 

Internet of things referes to embeeded computers that are connected to the internet, typically via wireless networks.

### PMD (Personal Mobile Device) 

This is a term that is a collection of wireless devices with multimedia user interfacs (cell phones, tabelt computer, etc.) 

These are meida devices, so a real-time perfromance requirement means a segment of the application has an absolute maximum execution time. 

Now there is certain phrase, called soft real-time where we have the average time for a particular task is contrained as well as the number of instances when some maximum time is exceeded. 

The main characteristics of these devices are to minimize the memory and the need to use energy efficiently. 

### Desktop Computing 

The main goal is for price-performance here where the combination of performance and price of a system is what matters most. 

### Servers 

Servers have become the backbone of large-scale enterprise computing, where it's basically the replacement for large scale mainframes.

A characteristic of servers is scalability e.g. the computing capcity, the memory, the storage, and the I/O bandwidth of a server is crucial. With this in mind, we also have that servers have effecitive throughput where the overall performance of the server either in terms of transaction per minute ot web pages served per second. 

### Cluser/Warehouse-Scale Computers (WSC)

A cluster is basically a large number of desktops or servers connected together in the scale of tens or thousands that act as one. The most expensive part about these WSC is that of power and cooling of computers inside of a warehouse. 

Now there is a stark difference between these and servers is that WSC use redudant, inexpensive components as the building blocks where they rely on software later to catch and isolate the many failures taht will happen with computing at this large scale. 

Now Super Computers are realted to WSC in the sense that they are just as expensive, the difference is that super computers differ by emphasizeing floating point performance and by running large, communication intensive batch programs that can run for weeks at a time. Where WSC focuses on interactive application, large scale storage, depandability, and high internet bandwidth.
